      subtitle: 'some tools that I recommend for academic research'
      text: |
        - Here are three tools that significantly improved my research workflow: 
        - **[Deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)**  
          When I need quick AI assistance for technical problems, **[Deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)** has become my go-to tool. Its R1 version responds almost instantly, and what's really cool is you can actually see how the AI thinks through problems step by step - like watching someone's thought process in real time. This transparency helps me adjust my questions better when the initial response isn't quite right.
        - **[Inciteful](https://inciteful.xyz/)**  
          For literature discovery, I prefer **[Inciteful](https://inciteful.xyz/)** over Connected Papers because it lets me analyze multiple papers at once. Imagine being able to search for papers based on 5-10 papers simultaneously - it's like having a research map that shows hidden relationships between different papers. By identifying works that have multiple references to my input papers, it reveals connections that single-paper analysis would miss, creating more comprehensive research maps.
        - **[Undermind](https://www.undermind.ai/home/)**  
          When I'm not exactly sure what keywords to search, **[Undermind](https://www.undermind.ai/home/)** is my secret weapon. Unlike traditional keyword searches, its AI-powered system allows you to search without any keywords - you can progressively narrow or broaden the scope through dialogue, it understands the context like a research partner would. The downside is it is very slow, since it need to use LLM for vague searching.
